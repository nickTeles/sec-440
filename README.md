The Constrictor Ransomware was created by Ethan Allis & Nicholas Teles in 2020 to demonstrate the effectiveness of simple ransomware and how to mitigate it. Constrictor is made for educational purposes and has safeguards in place to prevent accidental encryption. It is able to take specific file types designated in the code and encrypt all specified files in a given drive once it is run. It uses 128 bit encryption and is able to run multi-threading operations to increase efficiency. It utilizes sockets to transmit relevant data back to the attacker which can then be used to extract the ransom. Constrictor should never be used outside of its educational context.
